# About this repository

This repository contains samples of my editing. For each of these samples, I partnered with a subject-matter expert (SME) who wrote the content in Google Docs, where I then edited it. If time permitted, I also tested the SME's code in the relevant environment, such as Android Studio for Android content. After the SME addressed all my edits, the SME then added the content to Google's version-control system, where I reviewed it again. If necessary, I suggested further edits. Otherwise, I approved it for publication.
