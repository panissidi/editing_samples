# About this repository

This repository contains examples of my editing. If a sample is in this repository, it means that I partnered with a subject-matter expert (SME) who wrote the content, and I edited it. In some cases, I also tested the code to ensure that it worked. I wanted to show the original and revised versions of each example, but I'm only allowed to share the published versions, so I linked to them in a Markdown file that's organized by product area.
