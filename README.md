# About this repository

This repository contains samples of my editing. 

After I was assigned to edit these samples, the workflow followed these steps:
1. In the relevant environments, I edited and tested the content. For example, I edited the Android content in Google Docs, and tested it in Android Studio.
1. If necessary, the subject-matter expert (SME) reviewed and addressed my edits, and then I reviewed their changes.
1. The SME added the content to Google's version-control system, staged it, and shared it with me for a final review.
1. If necessary, I provided further feedback, the SME addressed my additional feedback, and I reviewed their changes.
1. I approved the content.
