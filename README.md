# About this repository

This repository contains samples of my editing. 

For editing assignments, I follow these steps:
1. I partner with a SME from the PA at hand who already wrote the documentation. 
1. I edit the SME's documentation so that it aligns with Google's style guide for developer documentation and test it to ensure that it works. In doing so, I use a combination of direct and tracked edits for minor issues, and comments for larger issues. 
1. The SME addresses my feedback until we both approve. 
1. Either I, the SME, or another member of our teams stages and publishes the documentation through our CMS.
