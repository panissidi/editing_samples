# About this repository

This repository contains samples of my editing for which I followed these steps: 
1. I partnered with a subject-matter expert (SME) from the relevant PA. 
1. I edited the SME's documentation so that it aligned with Google's style guide for developer documentation and performed a QA check.
1. I waited for the SME to address my edits and reviewed the documentation again to ensure that it aligned with Google's style guide and worked as expected. 
1. Either I, the SME, or another member of our teams staged and published the documentation through our internal content-management system.
