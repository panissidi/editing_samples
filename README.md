# About this repository

This repository contains samples of my editing. For these samples, a subject-matter expert (SME) wrote the content, and I edited it. In some cases when time permitted, I also tested the SME's code to ensure that it worked. I wanted to show the original and revised versions of each example, but I'm only allowed to share the published versions, so I linked to them in a Markdown file that's organized by product area.
