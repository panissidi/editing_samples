# About this repository

This repository contains samples of my editing. 

For these editing samples, I followed these steps:
1. I partnered with a SME from the product area (PA) at hand who already wrote the documentation. 
1. I edited the SME's documentation so that it aligned with Google's style guide for developer documentation and tested it to ensure that it worked. In doing so, I used a combination of direct and tracked edits for minor issues, and comments for larger issues. 
1. The SME addressed my feedback until we both approved. 
1. Either I, the SME, or another member of our teams staged and published the documentation through our CMS.
